# portfolio-page

Creating a personal portfolio page while learning best practices for front end developers.

Goals:

Better understanding of the following:

- Gulp
- Sass
- Browser-sync
- Bem naming convention

Once completed I hope to gather more control over these sections of the front-end development sector.
